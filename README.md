## Overview 

Do you want to learn the way of the sword? The experience of **VR-The Way of the Sword** is a revenge story, like the best martial arts films. Defend the castle from enemy hordes, avenge your comrades and defeat the final boss. Use your swordsmanship and hand-forming runic signs to unleash devastating magic to face your opponents.

In this game you will face various types of enemies with increasing difficulty and increasing intelligence. The opponents' **AIs** were obtained through **reinforcement learning**: each character ran thousands of combat simulations against himself or his previous versions to hone his skills.
Details about the implementation, training, various types of enemies and the obtained results can be found in the `docs` folder.

## Installation

The project is already in executable format (*.exe*) for Windows operating systems. It requires a virtual reality device for the game experience to work properly. It was built through the Unity development platform for VR applications.

## Project Goal 

The goal of this project is to create a video game, using the Unity graphics engine, that is compatible with the use of virtual reality platforms such as the Oculus Rift device. For this purpose, in addition to modeling the game environment and its dynamics, agents have been created, which operate as opponents for the player, both through classic Artificial Intelligence schemes and through Deep Reinforcement Learning.

## How to Play
Download the folder and unpack the .rar files in *GameExecutable* directory, ther run *MlAgentsTest.exe*.
